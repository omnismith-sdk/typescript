## createDashboardBlock

> CreateDashboardBlock201Response createDashboardBlock(dashboardId, createDashboardBlockRequest, xOmnismithProjectId)

Create a new block in a dashboard

Creates a new visualization block widget on a dashboard canvas. Supports four block types: stat (single KPI counter of matching entities), chart (time-series telemetry multi-line/bar graph aggregating metric data), gauge (metric threshold gauge with min/max bounds and percentage progress), and list (filtered and sorted entity table). Grid placement is defined via x, y, cols, rows layout parameters.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  DashboardBlocksApi,
} from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';
import type { CreateDashboardBlockOperationRequest } from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing @omnismith-sdk/typescript SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: bearerAuth
    accessToken: "YOUR BEARER TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new DashboardBlocksApi(config);

  const body = {
    // string | Target dashboard unique identifier (UUID)
    dashboardId: 0190a1b2-c3d4-7e8f-9a0b-1c2d3e4f5a6b,
    // CreateDashboardBlockRequest | Dashboard block creation payload
    createDashboardBlockRequest: ...,
    // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential\'s `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)
    xOmnismithProjectId: 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d,
  } satisfies CreateDashboardBlockOperationRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.createDashboardBlock(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Run the test

## resolveDashboardBlock

> ResolvedBlockResponse resolveDashboardBlock(dashboardId, blockId, xOmnismithProjectId)

Resolve a dashboard block to its computed data

Executes the underlying data query for a dashboard block and returns computed real-time aggregated metrics and time-series telemetry. Returns a typed payload matching the block type: stat (matching entity count), gauge (current metric value, min/max bounds, progress percentage), chart (time-series data point series bucketed by time intervals with aggregation functions), or list (hydrated entity items with dynamic attributes).
