## createAttribute

> CreateAttribute201Response createAttribute(createAttributeRequest, xOmnismithProjectId)

Create a new attribute

Defines a new attribute in the project schema. Attributes can be of kind Dimension (0), Metric (1), List (2), or Reference (3). Specify the storage data type (String: 0, Number: 1, Boolean: 2, Datetime: 3, Date: 4, File: 5, Image: 6, Markdown: 7), name, optional project-unique slug (auto-generated from name if omitted), optional template associations, and an optional reference_config if kind is Reference (3). Subject to project tier quota constraints.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  AttributesApi,
} from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';
import type { CreateAttributeOperationRequest } from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing @omnismith-sdk/typescript SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: bearerAuth
    accessToken: "YOUR BEARER TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new AttributesApi(config);

  const body = {
    // CreateAttributeRequest
    createAttributeRequest: ...,
    // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential\'s `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)
    xOmnismithProjectId: 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d,
  } satisfies CreateAttributeOperationRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.createAttribute(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Run the test
example().catch(console.error);
```

### Parameters


| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **createAttributeRequest** | [CreateAttributeRequest](CreateAttributeRequest.md) |  | |

The value must be one of the projects in the credential\&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;.

## getAttributeReferenceConfig

> ReferenceConfigResponse getAttributeReferenceConfig(id, xOmnismithProjectId)

Get reference configuration for an attribute

Retrieves the relational reference target configuration for a Reference-type (attribute_type &#x3D; 3) attribute. Returns the target template UUID and target display attribute UUID used for entity reference pointer resolution.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  AttributesApi,
} from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';
import type { GetAttributeReferenceConfigRequest } from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing @omnismith-sdk/typescript SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: bearerAuth
    accessToken: "YOUR BEARER TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new AttributesApi(config);

  const body = {
    // string | UUID of the Reference attribute
    id: 018b2f1b-8c1a-75b3-8000-7f0000010000,
    // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential\'s `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)
    xOmnismithProjectId: 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d,
  } satisfies GetAttributeReferenceConfigRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.getAttributeReferenceConfig(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Run the test
example().catch(console.error);
```

## listAttributes

> ListAttributes200Response listAttributes(xOmnismithProjectId)

List all attributes

Retrieves all schema attributes defined in the active project. Attributes represent the core schema building blocks across 4 kinds: Dimension (0), Metric (1), List (2), and Reference (3). Each attribute defines its storage data type (String: 0, Number: 1, Boolean: 2, Datetime: 3, Date: 4, File: 5, Image: 6, Markdown: 7), unique slug, optional description, associated templates, and reference configurations.

## patchAttribute

> patchAttribute(id, patchAttributeRequest, xOmnismithProjectId)

Patch an attribute (granular partial update)

Applies partial modifications to an existing attribute without overwriting omitted fields. Allows independently changing name, description, slug, template associations, reference configuration, or transitioning data type. Lossless data type transition rules apply when updating data_type (Dimension only: Number(1)-&gt;String(0), Boolean(2)-&gt;String(0), Date(4)&lt;-&gt;Datetime(3), Date(4)/Datetime(3)-&gt;String(0), String(0)&lt;-&gt;Markdown(7)). Template associations merge and preserve restricted templates.

## updateAttribute

> updateAttribute(id, updateAttributeRequest, xOmnismithProjectId)

Update an attribute (full replacement)

Performs a full update of an existing attribute definition. Supports updating name, description, slug, template associations, reference configuration, and lossless data type transitions. Data type transitions are permitted only for Dimension (0) attributes and must follow lossless compatibility: Number(1) -&gt; String(0), Boolean(2) -&gt; String(0), Date(4) &lt;-&gt; Datetime(3), Date(4)/Datetime(3) -&gt; String(0), and String(0) &lt;-&gt; Markdown(7). Non-lossless transitions or transitions on non-dimension attributes will return HTTP 422. Template associations preserve restricted templates the caller cannot see.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,

### Parameters


| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | `string` | UUID of the attribute to update | [Defaults to `undefined`] |
| **updateAttributeRequest** | [UpdateAttributeRequest](UpdateAttributeRequest.md) |  | |
| **xOmnismithProjectId** | `string` | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential\&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. | [Optional] [Defaults to `undefined`] |

### Return type

`void` (Empty response body)

### Authorization

[bearerAuth](../README.md#bearerAuth)

### HTTP request headers

- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Accept**: `application/json`


### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **204** | Attribute updated successfully |  -  |
| **400** | Bad Request |  -  |
| **401** | Unauthorized |  -  |
| **404** | Not Found |  -  |
| **409** | Conflict. Either the request collides with existing state, or no project is selected — the caller is authenticated but this operation is tenant-scoped. The two are told apart by the body\&#39;s &#x60;code&#x60; field, which is &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60; in the second case and absent in the first. |  -  |
| **422** | Validation Error |  -  |

## updateAttributeItem

> updateAttributeItem(id, itemId, updateListItemRequest, xOmnismithProjectId)

Update a list item of an attribute

Updates the display value and/or sort order of an existing list item belonging to a List-type (attribute_type &#x3D; 2) attribute. Validates that the list item exists and belongs to the specified attribute.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  AttributesApi,
} from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';
import type { UpdateAttributeItemRequest } from '@omnismith-sdk/typescript';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing @omnismith-sdk/typescript SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: bearerAuth
    accessToken: "YOUR BEARER TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new AttributesApi(config);

  const body = {
    // string | UUID of the parent List attribute
    id: 018b2f1b-8c1a-75b3-8000-7f0000010000,
    // string | UUID of the list item to update
    itemId: 019a6b2c-8c3a-7c2e-8b3f-6c8a1a2b3c4d,
    // UpdateListItemRequest
    updateListItemRequest: ...,
    // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential\'s `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored.

    xOmnismithProjectId: 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d,
  } satisfies UpdateAttributeItemRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.updateAttributeItem(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Run the test
example().catch(console.error);
```

### Parameters


| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | `string` | UUID of the parent List attribute | [Defaults to `undefined`] |
| **itemId** | `string` | UUID of the list item to update | [Defaults to `undefined`] |
| **updateListItemRequest** | [UpdateListItemRequest](UpdateListItemRequest.md) |  | |
| **xOmnismithProjectId** | `string` | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential\&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. | [Optional] [Defaults to `undefined`] |

### Return type

`void` (Empty response body)

### Authorization

[bearerAuth](../README.md#bearerAuth)

### HTTP request headers

- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Accept**: `application/json`


### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **204** | List item updated successfully |  -  |
| **400** | Bad Request |  -  |
| **401** | Unauthorized |  -  |
| **404** | Not Found - List item or Attribute not found |  -  |
| **422** | Validation Error |  -  |
| **409** | No project is selected. The caller is authenticated but the request is tenant-scoped, so a project must be selected before it can be answered. The response body carries &#x60;\&quot;code\&quot;: \&quot;no_project_selected\&quot;&#x60;, which clients branch on to offer a project picker rather than an access-denied message. |  -  |
